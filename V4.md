# **Getting started with V4.0 development board**

![](./media/ksuno.jpg)

# **What Is Arduino?**

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and 
software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects.


# **V4.0 Development Board**
Keyestudio V4.0 development board is fully compatible with Arduino UNO REV3.  
It has 14 digital input/output pins(of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6
analog inputs, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an
ICSP header, and a reset button.

What’s more, you can burn the firmware for ATMEGA328P-PU through the built-in
ICSP port. The firmware of this chip is burnt well before delivery. Therefore,
you don’t need to burn the firmware.

The power can be supplied through USB wire, DC head and Vin GND pins.


# **Download Arduino IDE**

You can tell your Arduino what to do by writing code in the Arduino programming language 
and using the Arduino development environment.

## **A. Windows System**

You could download Arduino IDE from the official website: [https://www.arduino.cc/](https://www.arduino.cc/)

Enter the link and click **SOFTWARE**: 

![](./media/image-20230331165128482-1685496644801-1.png)

There are various versions of IDE for Arduino. Just download a version compatible with your system. 

![](./media/image-20230531112709308.png)

Here we will show you how to download and install the windows version of Arduino IDE. 

There are two versions of IDE for WINDOWS system. You can choose between the installer (.exe) and the Zip file.
 For installer, it can be directly downloaded, without the need of installing it manually while for Zip package,
  you will need to install the driver manually.

![](./media/image-20230331165316657-1685496675570-5.png)


You just need to click **JUST DOWNLOAD**.

## **B. Mac System**

The versions of Arduino IDE vary from operation systems.

For how to download Arduino IDE on Mac, please refer to Windows:

# **Install Board Driver**

## **Install CP2102 Driver on Windows System**

Download: [https://fs.keyestudio.com/CP2102-WINDOWS](https://fs.keyestudio.com/CP2102-WINDOWS)

Click the link to download ![image-20230426100746100](./media/image-20230426100746100.png), and we unzip it to ![image-20230426100852988](./media/image-20230426100852988.png). 

Unzip again and we will get the folder ![image-20230426101012182](./media/image-20230426101012182.png). Please remember the path of this folder for later use. 

 Right click Computer----- Properties----- Device Manager.  

![img](./media/wps5.jpg)

The yellow exclamation mark on the page implies an unsuccessful  installation and you should double click ![img](./media/wps6.jpg), then click “**Update Drive...**”to update the driver. 

![img](./media/wps7.jpg)

Click “**Browse my computer for drivers**” to find the downloaded Arduino software.

![img](./media/wps8.jpg)

There is a DRIVERS folder in Arduino software installed package, please open this folder and check the driver of CP210X series chips.

Click “Browse...”, then search the driver of CP2102 and click“Next”.

![wps9](./media/wps9.png)

After a while, the driver is installed successfully.

## **Windows Arduino IDE Upload Code**

Upload code: An examples code is provided here: it will print “Hello Keyestudio!” per second.

Copy and paste the following code to Arduino IDE: 

```c
/*
  keyestudio 
  Print “Hello Keyestudio!”
  http://www.keyestudio.com
*/
void setup() {  
    // put your setup code here, to run once:
    Serial.begin(9600);  //Set the serial port baud rate to 9600
}

void loop() {  
    // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
    Serial.println("Hello Keyestudio!");  //Serial port printing
 	delay(1000);  //Delay of 1 second
}
```

![](./media/image-20230531163632939.png)

Click “Tools”——>“Board”——> Arduino AVR Boards, and here we choose Arduino Uno as our development board. 

![](./media/123456-1685520938684-103.png)

Choose the correct COM port.

If there are so many ports that you have no idea which is the correct one, you may unplug the board to check which one disappears. If there is no COM port, please check whether the driver is installed.

![wps11](./media/wps11.jpg)

In our demostration, the port is COM3, so we click “Tools”to choose“COM3” in “Port”.

![456789](./media/456789.png)

If your board is successfully connected, it will show on the interface. 

![image-20230531164139295](./media/image-20230531164139295.png)

Click ![image-20230531164208065](./media/image-20230531164208065.png)to compile the code. If it succeeds, the following two show up:

This is the end of how to upload code!

Now please import libraries for IDE, otherwise an error will occur. 





# **How To Import Library**

First of all, the corresponding Arduino library files are required. 

## **A. What are Libraries ?**

Libraries are a collection of code that make it easy for you to connect a sensor,display, module, etc.

For example, the built-in LiquidCrystal library helps talk to LCD displays. 

There are hundreds of additional libraries available on the Internet for download. The built-in libraries and some of these additional libraries are listed in the reference.

If there is an error 'No such file or directory' when compiling or uploading code, it means the library file is missing. As shown in the figure below, the error occurred when uploading LCD1602 module code due to the missing 'LiquidCrystal_I2C' library file.

![image-20231030131942400](./media/image-20231030131942400.png)

## **B. How to Install a Library ?**

<p style="color:red;">Let's take adding the "LiquidCrystal_I2C" library file as an example.<p>

Here we will introduce the most simple way to add libraries.

Click **Skerch > Include Library > Add .Zip Library...** in sequence. 


![5646545](./media/5646545.png)

Find files(.zip) you need to add as library and wait. “**Library installed**” will be displayed if library is successfully added.

![446518](./media/446518.png)

![image-20231031114018284](./media/image-20231031114018284.png)

**Dynamic operation example:**

![146185](./media/146185.gif)

For how to include a library, the method of the two system is the same.
